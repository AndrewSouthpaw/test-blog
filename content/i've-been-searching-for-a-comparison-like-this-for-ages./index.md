I’ve been searching for a comparison like this for ages. Thank you for finally putting in concrete terms the fact that mocha \*is faster\* than Jest despite everyone talking about how “blazing fast” Jest runs. I happen to love Jest and the features it offers, but I find it strange how people keep raving about its speed when we found mocha to be ~10x faster.
