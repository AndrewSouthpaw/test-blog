For me, the mock fails to compile:

```
● Test suite failed to run

.../__mocks__/react-router-dom.js: Unexpected token (6:39)
        4 | // Just render plain div with its children
        5 | 
      > 6 | rrd.BrowserRouter = ({ children }) => (<div>{children}</div>)
          |                                        ^


```

Am I missing something?
